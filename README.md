## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🧾 Tips Dataset
- Explored customer tipping behavior.
- Visualized relationships between total bill, tip, gender, day, and time.
- Used pairplots, histograms, boxplots, and bar charts.
- Final insights:
  - Higher bills generally lead to higher tips.
  - Males tipped slightly more, but female servers received higher tips on average.
  - Dinner sessions had higher tips than lunch.

### 2. 🚢 Titanic Dataset
- Explored survival rates among Titanic passengers.
- Visualized impact of gender, age, class, and fare on survival.
- Cleaned missing data thoughtfully.
- Final insights:
  - Females and 1st-class passengers had higher survival rates.
  - Children and younger passengers had a better chance of survival.
  - Most non-survivors were from 3rd class.
